<hl> About Me </hl>
<p> My name is Icencia Noel. I am 17 years old, attending Stamford High School. I'm an uprising senior and in the future, I hope to pursue the career of becoming a pediatric nurse. 
  My nationality is Haitian. 
 I really like pizza, shopping, Rihanna, shoes, YouTube and Netflix. What I really dislike are snakes. Eww! They're so gross!
  I'm also not a big fan of birds and homework (homework should really be outdated already). 
  A fun fact about me is that I had to teach myself English and now I'm taking AP LIT as an uprising senior (: !
  My favorite websites to go on are: YouTube, Netflix, Charolette Russe, PINK, Forever 21, and H&M.
